On unpatched consoles, once a payload was sent, then quickly copied into the memory buffer behind the stack, it overflowed the memory buffer into the stack. This leads to a &quot;smashed stack&quot; and unsigned code execution within a bootROM context, giving us access to nearly everything on the console. We use it here to launch Atmosphère.</p><p>If you choose the emuMMC path introduced later in the guide, it&#39;ll be important to disable the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Automatic Save Data Cloud</a> function beforehand, as well as making sure <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41221/~/how-to-set-or-change-the-primary-nintendo-switch-console-for-a-nintendo-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the Switch is set as the primary Pass-Enabled console</a>. <br></p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p><a href="./entering_rcm.html">Continue to Entering RCM</a></p></div><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Frequently Asked Questions about this page</summary><ul><li><p><strong>Q: How does the RCM exploit work on unpatched Nintendo Switch consoles?</strong></p><p>A: For more information, please reference <a href="./../../fusee_gelee.html">this page</a>.

RCM is an intended mode for all Switch consoles. The exploit is the unintended effect that only some consoles can use. Consoles with the Tegra X1+ have a completely new bootROM with no evidence of the exploit, while &quot;patched&quot; V1 systems have an IROM patch to the bootROM applied that effectively removes fusee-gelee as well.</p></li></ul></details>',5)])])}const m=t(s,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
