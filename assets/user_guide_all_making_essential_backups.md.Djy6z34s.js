This is why it is <strong>mandatory</strong> to keep at least one copy of your NAND backup in a safe place, even if it takes a lot of space. The consequence to not having one is, at best, a Switch that cannot connect to Nintendo Network, or at worst, a full brick. However, it is important to note that it is nearly impossible to permanently brick a hackable Nintendo Switch.</p></li></ul></details>',10)])])}const k=o(c,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,k as default};
