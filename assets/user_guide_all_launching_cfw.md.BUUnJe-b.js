The system version should be prefixed with an S or E, standing for SysMMC or EmuMMC respectively. Seeing either of these confirms which environment you are using.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q: What options do you have for rebooting to Hekate while booted into CFW?</strong></p><p>A: If you use a modchip, your console will automatically boot into whatever payload that your modchip would normally boot into via a coldboot, after clicking the restart button in the power-off menu. This can be any payload, but ideally is Hekate. If you use no modchip (and you&#39;re using a V1 console), your console will &quot;reboot-to-payload&quot; by default, triggering whatever fusee payload is located in <code>atmosphere/reboot_to_payload.bin</code>. This can be any payload, but ideally is Hekate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Q: Where can I find additional homebrew apps?</strong></p><p>A: One of the more convenient sources is the <a href="https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Homebrew App Store</a>, hosted by <a href="https://gitlab.com/4TU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">4TU</a>.
