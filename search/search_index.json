Discord Help For live support with this guide please visit us in #switch-assistance over at the Nintendo Homebrew Discord . What is homebrew? Homebrew is a term for unoffical software written by hobbyists and amateur developers for locked down systems (i.e. the Switch). This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more. Homebrew can be run for free on your Switch through Custom Firmware as long as you have a \"first-generation\" system, and a USB-C cable. What is Custom Firmware? Custom Firmware (\u201cCFW\u201d) is a piece of software that modifies the system firmware. Atmosphere, for example, does this by running in the background and patching the OS on the fly. This allows one to extend the functionality of their system by giving homebrew higher levels of permission than most userland exploits and can be used to provide extra features for homebrew devs and users to take advantage of for various purposes, for instance, game modding using LayeredFS. CFW can be set up on any first-generation console on any version (but will require additional tools). What does this guide install? This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Switch from Stock Firmware to Atmosphere Custom Firmware. fusee-gelee is currently the best method of launching Custom Firmware that gives us nearly full control of the system. It utilizes a vulnerability in the bootROM of the first-generation Switch systems, allowing us to send any payload we want to the Switch's recovery mode, instead of only ones that Nintendo have authorized. What can I do with Custom Firmware? Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes and splash screens Use \u201cROM hacks\u201d for games that you own Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew What do I need to know before starting? Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Switch hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They\u2019re rare but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY. This guide will work on first-generation Switch consoles in all regions on any firmware version. You will need one of the following in order to successfully follow this guide: A PC and a USB cable capable of data transfer between your Switch and your PC An Android device and a USB cable capable of data transfer between your Switch and your Android device This does not work on every android phone A Lightning-OTG adapter, a jailbroken iOS device and a USB cable capable of data transfer between your Switch and the adapter This method is not covered by the guide, but you can read more about it at this website You will also need a micro SD card that is at least 64 gigabytes or larger if you plan on following this guide through the emummc path, which is safer and strongly recommended. If you must use a smaller SD card, it is possible with the sysmmc path, but strongly not recommended. Finally, you will need a way to access Recovery Mode. (This will be further explained in the \"Entering RCM section\") If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, Nintendo Account, saves, etc will be preserved). Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off. Custom Firmware is not permanent with current methods, and will be unloaded upon rebooting the system. It is advised that you read the entire guide from start to finish one or more times before actually running through the guide with your system.

Currently two hardware revisions of the Switch exist. Any Switch bought or manufactured before the middle of 2018 has a bootrom bug that allows us to run code regardless of the firmware version on the Switch. When Nintendo updates the system, however, CFW will usually need an update to account for it. This bug cannot be fixed by Nintendo once the console leaves the factory, unless the console is sent in for repairs. This means that all current and future firmwares will be able to launch CFW through this exploit on the old hardware revision. Any console purchased after approximately August 2018 is likely to be patched. This includes the latest units on shelves, referred to as 'red box' or 'Mariko'. Mariko is hardware patched, but may come on a vulnerable firmware. Currently the only way to know if your Switch is hackable is by trying to send the payload in RCM. Even with this exploit fixed, many Switches on 8.0.1 and below will be hackable to some degree in the future (see Should I update my Firmware? for much more detailed information). The serial number on the back of the box can possibly tell you which consoles are patched and which aren't. See here for an up to date list. How do I use the exploit? How can I boot into RCM? To launch CFW through the exploit, the Switch needs to be in \"Recovery Mode\"(RCM). The easiest way to enter RCM is by grounding pin 10 in the right joycon rail and holding VOL+ on boot. Several methods and designs to do this exist, see our guide for more information. Once the Switch is in RCM it needs to be connected to either a computer, phone or dongle to send the exploit and the payload. This procedure needs to happen every time the Switch boots from a completely \"off\" state, otherwise the Switch will boot into the stock firmware. What makes a good jig good? Can I use a paperclip? Most people prefer to use 3d-printed jigs to enter RCM. These jigs are made in a way that they slide into the right joycon rail and have a piece of connected wire that then bridges pin 10 and one of the grounded pins on the Switch. A lot of different designs for these jigs exist, but it is important to understand, that these jigs can damage the Switch if they are made in a bad way. Since the wire in the jig is supposed to touch the pads inside the Switch's joycon rail, it is important to use wire that is thin, not rigid and bent/not pointy. Paperclips make for potentially dangerous jigs, as they are made out of a hard material, are rigid and pointy and can easily scratch off the pads inside the Switch. A good jig uses 32Gauge(0.2mm diameter) wire and is bent in a way that the end of the wire does not scratch the pads. You can download and 3d-print your own jig and use the pictures on this website to guide you on how to bend the wire correctly. Premade jigs can be found on online marketplaces for cheap. Is there an easier way to enter RCM? To enter RCM more comfortably a solution called \"AutoRCM\" exists. Once set up, this method will always boot the Switch into RCM, even without a jig or holding any buttons. This works by \"bricking\" the Switch in a controlled manner. The Switch detects that something is wrong and boots into RCM to get repaired. The big downside of this method is, that it is impossible to boot the Switch without a computer, phone or dongle, as it will never boot into stock firmware by itself, and that it requires an SD card with the proper CFW files on it at all times. In addition, if the battery of the Switch is completely drained, the Switch will need to charge to at least 10% in Hekate before launching Atmosphere, otherwise the Switch will refuse to boot due to the low battery. Charging in RCM is not recommended as this is very slow. AutoRCM can be reversed, but it is advised to keep a working NAND and BOOT0/1 backup before using it. Many Android-phones are able to send the exploit to the Switch, making them a perfect portable way to launch CFW. Different designs for portable dongles exist, ranging from Raspberry Pi Zero and Arduino projects to internal dongles, that work completely autonomous. The latter should only be done by advanced users, as it requires soldering onto the Switch mainboard itself. Should I update my Firmware? If your Switch is one of the new hardware revisions that patched the exploit in RCM and you are on firmware 7.0.1 or lower, you should not update if you want to have CFW in the forseeable future. If your Switch is one of the older hardware revisions and you don't mind having to use jigs/hardmods/AutoRCM and sending the exploit via computer, phone or dongle everytime you want to launch into CFW then it is completely safe to update. If you want the chance to maybe, one day, not have to use a external device, then it is recommended to stay on a FW as low as possible. Beware that this means that you potentially need to wait for a very long time (months to years) for this to happen, if ever. Private exploits to launch CFW over the Browser are known to exist for firmwares up to 7.0.1. Downgrading on the Switch is possible, but it requires using AutoRCM and a custom bootloader payload to bypass the Switch's several hardware anti-downgrade mechanisms. This will not work on an unpatched system, and is practically useless for most users. On every boot the Switch firmware checks how many e-fuses have been burned and how many e-fuses the Switch expects to be burned. Major updates to the Switch, or updates in which a large vulnerability has been patched, irreversibly burn one of the Switch's 64 \"e-fuses\". If the Switch ever detects that more e-fuses have been burned than expected (meaning a downgrade happened), it will refuse to boot. Replacing e-fuses is not an option. You can find more information about fuses here Atmosphere is maintained to support the latest firmware updates on unpatched units. The situation for patched and new units is as follows: \"Old\" Patched Switch (HAC-001): Do NOT update past 7.0.1. Units on 7.0.1 and below will eventually get CFW. Patched units that have upgraded to 8.0.0 or 8.0.1 will likely get homebrew. \"New\" Switch (HAC-001-01): Do NOT update past 8.0.1. Units on 8.0.1 and below will likely get homebrew. Units on 8.1.0 and higher are not expected to be hacked and can be updated. Switch Lite (HDH-001): Do NOT update past 8.0.1. Units on 8.0.1 and below will likely get homebrew. Units on 8.1.0 and higher are not expected to be hacked and can be updated. A method to update without burning e-fuses exists, but, like downgrading, it forces you to use AutoRCM and sending the exploit via USB every time, as booting into the stock firmware even once would instantly burn the e-fuse. Note that other anti-downgrade mechanisms exist, making it for example impossible to boot game carts on a firmware below 4.1/9.0.0 if the Switch has ever launched a game on firmware 4.1+/9.0.0+. This can only be worked around by completely disabling the game cart slot while on 4.1/9.0.0 or greater, which is similarly impractical for most users. Is it safe to use homebrew? Will I get banned? The Switch comes with a lot of telemetry, and has been called a \"telemetry monster\" by several prominent developers. As long as the Switch is connected to the internet, Nintendo gets a report about a lot of different actions and states and has the option to log or act on them. Even if the Switch is offline and connects to the internet at a later point, Nintendo still recieves information about what happened while the Switch was disconnected. To disable some of this telemetry, it is advised to disable the sending of error reports in the System Settings of the Switch. Additionally if you live in the EU you can set the \"do not share\" option on Nintendo's website to prevent your Switch from sending a lot of telemetry, although the effectiveness of this is questionable. Nintendo still receives a lot of information, even with those options disabled. We also cannot know if Nintendo decides to look for something in the logs and ban people in retrospect. They have also shown to expand their telemetry options with every other firmware update. Currently all bans have been for very obvious and intrusive actions, specifically: Developers using their unique Switch data to poke and reverse-engineer Nintendos Server responses People pirating games and using them online People changing their profile pictures to custom pictures People using savegame editors to unlock content that is not available yet and using it online (Splatoon 2) People cheating online in general (Modifying Cart stats in MK8) People installing homebrew NSP files, which Nintendo can pick up on with their telemetry Atmosphere stops some, but not all of Nintendo's telemetry, and prevents crash reports from being sent. This means Nintendo can't tell if anything, including homebrew or modded games crashed, and Atmosphere dumps the crash log to the SD card to help homebrew developers. However, Nintendo still receives information about what is being played, and general system report information. Atmosphere is not a silver bullet, and this does not mean that Nintendo won't decide to ban people for harmless homebrew in the future. If you are scared to get banned then don't use homebrew for now. Atmosphere now supports emuMMC (emuNAND): a copy of Switch system software, run entirely from the SD card instead. This erases ban risks due to the fact that emuMMC is run in a quarantined, offline state, not touching the internal memory. You are still able to boot into original firmware to play online. For patched units reliant on deja-vu, sysNAND will always have to be on a firmware below 4.1. For switches from 5.0 to 7.0.1 deja-vu isn't quite out yet but is coming soon. (Also please note that firmwares 8.0.0+ will never work with deja-vu) You can use an updated emuMMC dedicated to online/clean play, while your sysNAND is used offline for custom firmware. We do not recommend the use of ReiNX or SX OS for many reasons, primary among them that they use lots of assets from Atmosphere and offer no real benefit that Atmosphere does not offer anyway. We also do not recommend Kosmos, as its large amount of extras on top of regular Atmosphere make it difficult to troubleshoot strange issues. All of these alternative CFWs also tend to use non-conventional setups which can cause issues that make it difficult to troubleshoot, which is another reason we prefer using Atmosphere. Additionally, it is advised to use 90DNS which blocks connections to any Nintendo servers. If you use an emuNAND for CFW and keep your sysNAND clean for playing online, you should use 90DNS on your emuNAND. Note: Keeping your emuNAND \"dirty\" and your sysNAND \"clean\" pertains primarily to those using the RCM exploit. Users employing Nereba or Caffeine will do the opposite. What formats can homebrew come in Homebrew can come in two different formats, namely in nro files and in bin files. nro Files are placed in the switch folder on your SD card and can be launched using the Homebrew menu. bin This format is used as a payload and is to be pushed in RCM using a payload launcher like tegrarcmgui on windows and fusee-interfacee-tk on other operating systems. Homebrew risks Be careful with launching downloaded homebrew! If you don't know the source, it's best not to launch it. Homebrew can potentially damage your system! Atmosphere provides protections against common bricking methods, but these are not guaranteed to always work! What microSD card/format should I use? microSD cards that are 32GB or smaller can be used for homebrew, but are not recommended as these will not permit you to have a full NAND dump and/or an emuMMC on them. The recommended microSD card size is 128GB. This will permit you to make a full NAND dump as well as having enough space to run an emuNAND in the future while also having adequate space for homebrew. The recommended filesystem format is FAT32. While the Switch supports exFAT through an additional update from Nintendo, this filesystem is prone to corruption and as a result is not advisable. Fake microSD cards Do not buy microSD cards from sites like eBay. These microSD cards are often fake and do not have the advertised amount of storage and will result in data corruption if used. Amazon has had some problems with fake SD cards, so we recommend buying them at a physical store. Even on trustworthy sites, always, always check reviews on a product before buying!! If you suspect your microSD card is fake or damaged, see the instructions here to verify the integrity of your SD card. My homebrew is not showing up on the menu This is an issue primarily affecting macOS users, but may occur on other devices as well. If you are able to launch the homebrew menu, but you are not seeing some or any of your homebrew, you will need to unset the archive bit with Hekate. Send the Hekate payload to your Switch by following these instructions: here Click on Tools on the top menu bar In the bottom left corner click on Archive bit * AutoRCM Click on Fix Archive bit - this might take a while Press Close in the top right corner Press Home in the top menu bar to get back from where you started Follow the instructions at the Launching CFW page here to launch Atmosphere.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#what-firmware-versions-are-currently-hackable","text":"Currently two hardware revisions of the Switch exist.

For patched units reliant on deja-vu, sysNAND will always have to be on a firmware below 4.1. For switches from 5.0 to 7.0.1 deja-vu isn't quite out yet but is coming soon. (Also please note that firmwares 8.0.0+ will never work with deja-vu) You can use an updated emuMMC dedicated to online/clean play, while your sysNAND is used offline for custom firmware. We do not recommend the use of ReiNX or SX OS for many reasons, primary among them that they use lots of assets from Atmosphere and offer no real benefit that Atmosphere does not offer anyway. We also do not recommend Kosmos, as its large amount of extras on top of regular Atmosphere make it difficult to troubleshoot strange issues. All of these alternative CFWs also tend to use non-conventional setups which can cause issues that make it difficult to troubleshoot, which is another reason we prefer using Atmosphere. Additionally, it is advised to use 90DNS which blocks connections to any Nintendo servers. If you use an emuNAND for CFW and keep your sysNAND clean for playing online, you should use 90DNS on your emuNAND. Note: Keeping your emuNAND \"dirty\" and your sysNAND \"clean\" pertains primarily to those using the RCM exploit. Users employing Nereba or Caffeine will do the opposite.","title":"Is it safe to use homebrew?

To solve this, charge the console for approximately twenty minutes before booting into Hekate and selecting a boot option. After it's done booting, the console will now charge at a normal speed with a battery icon in the corner.

Hacking terms The following list is in alphabetical order. 90DNS : DNS that blocks system updates on the Nintendo Switch. This can be enabled by following the guide here . Atmosphere : The CFW developed by the Atmosphere-NX organization on GitHub and the one used in this guide. AutoRCM : A method that corrupts parts of your boot0 and boot1, causing the Switch to boot into RCM automatically. Using this requires an additional peripheral (such as a computer, phone, dongle or trinket) to be able to boot your Switch. boot0 and boot1 : Two partitions of the Switch NAND. CFW : Short for custom firmware. Custom firmware permits you to completely modify how your Switch works. Deja Vu : An unreleased exploit chain for the Nintendo Switch. The completely unpatched version of this chain will grant access to TrustZone, which effectively means being able to enter CFW. The TrustZone part of this exploit was patched in firmware version 5.0.0 and up, but normal homebrew access can still be gained up to firmware version 6.0.1. DNS : Domain Name System . Basically, it's the internet's addressbook. If you visit a website, the DNS is what tells you what server the site is hosted on. Dongle : Device you can plug in the charging port of your Switch to automatically send a payload if your Switch is in RCM. Encryption keys : Keys used to encrypt files from the Nintendo Switch. These can be dumped by following the guide here . BIS keys : Specific keys used to decrypt the NAND. fusee-gelee / ShofEL2 : Two names for two different implementations of the same exploit. This is an exploit that grants full bootrom access to the Nintendo Switch from the Tegra X1s RCM and permits us to run CFW. This exploit requires an external device and a tiny hardware modification. fusee-gelee is developed by an ex-ReSwitched developer, while ShofEL2 is developed by the failoverfl0w team. This guide uses fusee-gelee. hactool : Software used to decrypt Nintendo Switch files like .XCI and .NSP files. Hekate : A bootloader for the Nintendo Switch. The current guide uses this in combination with essential files from Atmosphere to boot CFW. Homebrew : Unsigned code that can be ran on the Nintendo Switch. Examples of homebrew include save editors, emulators and ports of PC games, but can also include completely original games. To run this code, you need to have an exploit. Homebrew launcher : Software developed by the Switchbrew team that lets you run other Homebrew. Jig : Refers to a piece of hardware that you can put in the Joycon rail to enter RCM. KIP : Short for Kernel Initial Process. These files can be loaded in when the Switch boots in CFW and provide additional functionality. NAND : The internal filesystem used by the Switch. Contains boot0 and boot1, as well as PRODINFO and various other partitions. nx-hbloader : Intermediary program used to load the Homebrew Launcher from CFW developed by Switchbrew. Comes bundled with Atmosphere. PRODINFO : A partition on the NAND of your Switch. This along with boot0 and boot1 is the only part of your Switch that can render it unbootable if improperly modified. Atmosphere backs up this partition on booting and it is included in your NAND backup. ReSwitched : A hacking team that is one of the main developers for Atmosphere. RCM : A shorthand for \"Recovery Mode\". When talking about hacking the Switch, this commonly refers to the Recovery Mode in the Tegra X1 chip that is included in the Nintendo Switch. Can be entered by holding down the Tegra X1 home button. This button is not the same as the home button on the joycons. Ways of pressing this button can be found here . TegraRCMGUI / fusee-interface-tk : Software used to run the fusee-gelee exploit on the Switch. Tegra X1 : A chip made by Nvidia that is used in the Nintendo Switch. Trinket : A tiny chip that is soldered on the Switch motherboard to automatically send a payload if it is in RCM. TrustZone : The highest security level on the Switch. XCI/NSP : Format used to dump games to. XCI is used for gamecard dumps, while NSP is for dumping digital titles. Resources The resources below are for users and developers interested in developing Homebrew or for those that want to get a more technical understanding of the various concepts. The ReSwitched FAQ lists a general overview of how the Switch works. Switchbrew is a wiki detailing the inner workings of the Nintendo Switch's firmware. libNX documentation .

After following our guide, your system will consist of three core elements that can be updated. Atmosphere, Hekate and your system firmware. Updating Atmosphere When updating Atmosphere always make sure to read the release notes . They may list important changes and modifications to your system. Updating from below Atmosphere 1.0.0 If you update from below Atmosphere 1.0.0, there are additional steps to follow. You will have to delete the sept folder from your sd, delete fusee-secondary.bin from your atmosphere folder and update your hekate config file: hekate_ipl.ini in the bootloader folder. When a new version of Atmosphere releases, you can update Atmosphere by following these steps: Turn off your Nintendo Switch and plug your SD card in your computer. Download the latest release of Atmosphere (Download the atmosphere-(version)-master-(version)+hbl-(version)+hbmenu-(version).zip release of Atmosphere.) Copy the contents of the Atmosphere .zip file to the root of your SD card. If you are prompted to overwrite files, do so. (If your hekate is not on the latest version) Update hekate via the steps below Put your SD card back in your Switch and launch CFW. Updating Hekate When updating Hekate always make sure to read the release notes . They may list important changes and modifications to your system. When a new version of Hekate releases, you can update by following these steps: Turn off your Nintendo Switch and plug your SD card in your computer. Download the latest version of Hekate (Download the hekate_ctcaer_(version).zip release of hekate). Copy the bootloader folder from the Hekate .zip file to the root of your SD card. If you are asked to overwrite or merge files while copying, say yes to merge/overwrite them. Put your SD card back in your Switch and launch Hekate. Go to the Options tab at the top right of the screen. Turn \"Update Reboot 2 Payload\" on the bottom right ON (if it isn't on already). Tap \"Save Options\" at the bottom of the screen. Updating your firmware Always check before updating your system firmware if the latest version of Atmosphere as well as the latest version of Hekate support the firmware version you are updating towards. In addition, updating to or past some firmwares update the gamecard firmware. Reference the table below for information about these. Updating from Updating towards Updates gamecard firmware Below 4.0.0 Below 4.0.0 No Below 4.0.0 4.0.0 or above Yes On or above 4.0.0, but below 9.0.0 At least 4.1.0 but below 9.0.0 No On or above 4.0.0, but below 9.0.0 9.0.0 or above Yes On or above 9.0.0, but below 11.0.0 At least 9.1.0 but below 11.0.0 No On or above 9.0.0, but below 11.0.0 11.0.0 or above Yes On or above 11.0.0 but below 12.0.0 At least 11.0.1 but below 12.0.0 No On or above 11.0.0 but below 12.0.0 12.0.0 or above Yes On or above 12.0.0 Latest supported Atmosphere & Hekate revision No If at least one of the versions you are updating towards also updates the gamecard firmware, you will not be able to downgrade below that version without making the gamecard slot unusable until you update. Atmosphere (and Hekate) come bundled with patches that automatically disable the gamecard slot if it is detected that the system has an older gamecard firmware that would be updated. If you boot into RCM on each boot (for example by using AutoRCM), this means that the gamecard slot will not be updated and you can downgrade below that version. If this happens, you will not be able to use the gamecard slot as long as you are on the newer firmware. Otherwise, you can safely update your system firmware through the system settings. Note about autoRCM If you have autoRCM enabled and you're updating your system while in stock firmware, updating will disable autoRCM and you will need to enter RCM manually to boot custom firmware again. To prevent autoRCM from being disabled, boot CFW on sysMMC and update through settings from there, as booting without AutoRCM will burn any preserved fuses . About emuMMC sysMMC and emuMMC have separate system firmwares and need to be updated separately. If you keep your emuMMC offline, you will have to use a gamecard to update your system firmware, synchronize it with another Nintendo Switch or dump an updated firmware from your sysMMC. Updating emuMMC by dumping an updated firmware from your sysMMC Do you have an eMMC backup yet? Please do not start this guide without doing a RAW GPP and a BOOT 0/1 eMMC backup! You can learn how to make one here . Downgrading This guide is made for updating your emuMMC. It is not for downgrading. Downgrading at all, sysMMC or emuMMC, is not recommended and not worth it. Downgrading is also very dangerous and can lead to serious complications even when performed correctly. What you will need The latest release of TegraExplorer The latest release of Atmosphere Preparing your SD card Insert your microSD card into your computer. Download TegraExplorer.bin and place it somewhere on your PC (A good idea is to put it where you keep all your switch payloads like Hekate). Update Atmosphere and Hekate by using the above guides. If you haven't already, update the sysMMC to the latest firmware. Dumping your sysMMC firmware Make sure your sysMMC is up to date. If your sysMMC is not up-to-date, update it through the System Settings. Inject TegraExplorer.bin using TegraRCMGUI (Like you would with Hekate). Using the joystick and the A buttons, select FirmwareDump.te , then select Dump sysmmc . Wait about 1-2 minutes for the tool to dump your firmware. When the tool finishes, press any button. Select Reboot to atmosphere/reboot_payload.bin . Updating your emuMMC with Daybreak In Hekate go to Launch -> Atmosphere FSS0 emuMMC . Once booted, hold R while launching a game to boot into the homebrew menu. Find Daybreak in the homebrew menu and launch it.

This vulnerability was independently discovered by several different Switch hacking teams, and multiple variants of it were released to the public in April 2018 after a 90-day disclosure period ended. Nintendo and NVIDIA were made aware of the issue before the public release as a result, and Switch systems that are not vulnerable to the exploit started being spotted in the wild in July 2018. NVIDIA publicly acknowledged the flaw in April as well. In July 2019, Nintendo announced updated consoles, a handheld variant of the Switch called the Switch Lite (HDH-001), and a new model of original Switch (HAC-001-01) with better battery life. Both of these new models use a new processor called the T210b01 (also known as T214 and Mariko) with a new bootROM, and are not hackable at the current time. Patched and Mariko units can be identified by their serial number. This number can be found on the bottom of your Switch adjacent to the USB-C port, or in the Settings applet at System -> Serial Information . Determining if your Switch is vulnerable The homebrew community has crowdsourced a list of known serial numbers which are vulnerable to fusee-gelee. If your serial number is on this list as \"potentially patched\", follow the guide and see if your system works. If your serial number is listed as \"patched\", there is nothing you can do at this time. If your system is patched, it is highly advised to keep it on 7.0.1 or lower, if possible, as there may be a vulnerability for these versions in the far future. DO NOT update patched consoles past 7.0.1 if you want to ever have a chance of running homebrew and/or CFW on them. Notice If you are unsure if your serial is patched, you can test your console yourself following the instructions here. Serial list The following information is based on this GBATemp thread .

Fortunately, due to the fusee-gelee vulnerability, this special mode acts as our gateway into CFW. There are several methods of entering RCM ( R e C overy M ode). The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10). Patched Switch Note that patched units can enter RCM, but it is not possible to send a payload on those systems. Also note that RCM is a different recovery mode than the one accessed by holding Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power. Note The order of methods on this page is in the order of ease. The easiest to immediately accomplish are listed at the top, and the most advanced/difficult methods are at the bottom. Instructions Power off the Switch and use one of the methods listed below to short the pins on the right joycon rail. Hold Volume Up and press the Power button. If your Switch displays the Nintendo logo and boots normally or immediately shuts down, you didn't successfully enter RCM and should try again. Otherwise, if your console did not turn on normally, and the screen remained black with no backlight, your Switch is in RCM. RCM Jig (Easiest for beginners) Click to expand! Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. Note Once you have successfully entered RCM, you can take the jig out of the joycon rail. This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest) Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 7 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pins 7 and 10 (shown below) together with a surface-mount 0805 10k resistor. Apart from using a physical switch/button, this is currently considered the safest method that involves soldering to pads. Here is an example from stuckpixel#3421 on the ReSwitched Discord server. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 9 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method will result in the right Joy-Con being detected as in wireless mode while attached to the Switch, and this method may result in the Joy-Con being permanently detected as wireless if you update the Joy-Con firmware while this mod is installed. In the latter case, fixing this requires opening up the Joy-Con and reseating the battery. It is recommended to solder pads 7 and 10 together with a resistor instead. Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pads 9 and 10 (seen below) together. This can either be done using a small wire, or directly bridging the pads with solder. Here is an example from YyAoMmIi#3705 on our Discord server. Bent Joy-Con Pins (Not recommended) Click to expand!

The best backup is the one you have but never need, and the worst backup is the one you need but never made. To save space, it's recommended to compress the end-result with a .zip file or something similar. It's highly recommended that you use an SD card that is formatted to FAT32 and has at least 32 gigabytes of space free. This will still work on smaller cards, but it's not ideal. Instructions Enter RCM and inject the Hekate payload Use the touch screen to navigate to Tools and then Backup eMMC Tap on eMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1 This should only take a few seconds, but if your SD card is very slow, it may take around a minute. Tap on Close to continue, then tap on eMMC RAW GPP This will take a long time. Expect it to take between 10 minutes to an hour (or more, if your SD card is very slow). On FAT32 SD cards or cards that have less than 32 gigabytes of space available, the NAND will be split into 1 or 2 gigabyte parts. Hekate will stop producing these parts when it runs out of space. When this happens, do the following: Power off your system Insert your SD card into your PC Move all files from the backup folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC Insert your SD card into your Switch Enter RCM again, inject Hekate again, and continue the backup by tapping on Tools > Backup eMMC > eMMC RAW GPP Repeat the process until the NAND is completely dumped Press Close > Home > Power Off Insert your SD card into your PC Copy the backup folder on your SD card to a safe location on your PC Getting your Console's Unique Keys Important These keys are critical to have. In an extreme emergency, they can be used in conjunction with your NAND backup and other tools to restore your console to a working state. Enter RCM and inject the Hekate payload. Tap the Payloads option, then press Lockpick_RCM.bin. If Lockpick_RCM asks you to select between SysNAND or EmuNAND, choose SysNAND by navigating with the volume buttons and pressing the power button. If not, continue with step 4. Lockpick_RCM should now inform you that your keys have been saved to /switch/prod.keys on the SD card. Press any button to return to the main menu. Navigate to 'Power off' with the volume buttons and select it with the power button. Insert your SD card into your PC.

Fortunately, due to the fusee-gelee vulnerability, this special mode acts as our gateway into CFW. There are several methods of entering RCM ( R e C overy M ode). The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10). Patched Switch Note that patched units can enter RCM, but it is not possible to send a payload on those systems. Also note that RCM is a different recovery mode than the one accessed by holding Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power. Note The order of methods on this page is in the order of ease. The easiest to immediately accomplish are listed at the top, and the most advanced/difficult methods are at the bottom. Instructions Power off the Switch and use one of the methods listed below to short the pins on the right joycon rail. Hold Volume Up and press the Power button. If your Switch displays the Nintendo logo and boots normally or immediately shuts down, you didn't successfully enter RCM and should try again. Otherwise, if your console did not turn on normally, and the screen remained black with no backlight, your Switch is in RCM. RCM Jig (Easiest for beginners) Click to expand! Note Some jig designs use paperclips, inheriting the same risks as the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method. Note Once you have successfully entered RCM, you can take the jig out of the joycon rail. This method is similar to the Metal Bridge / Paperclip method, but is more reliable and safer in many cases. Jigs hold a wire in place so the correct pins (10 and a ground) are shorted every time. In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4. Pin 4 provides 5v power to the Joycons, if connected to any other pin you will fry the console. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest) Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM. Soldered Joy-Con Pads - 7 & 10 Click to expand! Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pins 7 and 10 (shown below) together with a surface-mount 0805 10k resistor. Apart from using a physical switch/button, this is currently considered the safest method that involves soldering to pads. Here is an example from stuckpixel#3421 on the ReSwitched Discord server.

Note This method will result in the right Joy-Con being detected as in wireless mode while attached to the Switch, and this method may result in the Joy-Con being permanently detected as wireless if you update the Joy-Con firmware while this mod is installed. In the latter case, fixing this requires opening up the Joy-Con and reseating the battery. It is recommended to solder pads 7 and 10 together with a resistor instead. Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however the goal is to solder pads 9 and 10 (seen below) together. This can either be done using a small wire, or directly bridging the pads with solder. Here is an example from YyAoMmIi#3705 on our Discord server. Bent Joy-Con Pins (Not recommended) Click to expand!

The most affordable of these require nothing more than common household items, while the most reliable are very cheap ($10).

In the case you plan to make you own jig, this image lays out the pads numbers on the console. Make sure your jig NEVER touches pin 4.

Note This method requires opening your right Joy-Con, voiding its warranty. Not for the faint of heart. This method comes to us from the mind of pbanj#9188 on Discord. All pictures of this method in action were provided by him, with some supplementary images provided by eip \u221e#3283 on Discord. The goal of this method is to open the right handed Joy-Con to the point that you can reach the contact pads easily. This is similar to the previous method, however you will be soldering wires to pins 7 and 10 (shown below) and wiring them to the \"Joycon release button\" at the top back of the right hand Joycon. In order to start this method you will want to take two lengths of wire, and wrap one end of each into a small circle. You will then want to take the circular end of one of the wires and add a small amount of solder, keeping it mostly flat (ONLY DO THIS TO ONE OF THE WIRES!). You will then glue this wire down to the below point on the Joycon release button. Make sure glue doesn't cover the top of the solder/wire as it will act as a contact point. Also, ensure that you leave enough space for the button to function correctly. Try pushing the button from the outside and observing its travel path so that you can see where and how you should safely glue the solder glob. The first wire should now be in place as seen by the green circle below. The second wire does not need any solder, instead you will hold it in place using the screw as shown by the red circle in the picture below. Pressing the Joycon button in you should now notice the solder point you created making contact with the piece of metal held in by the screw. Once you have these elements in place you want to connect one wire to pad 7 and the other to pad 10 (it doesn't matter which is which). After that you have successfully created an RCM button on your Joycon. You will now need to hold down the Joycon release button when attempting to boot RCM.","title":"Soldered Joy-Con Pads - Physical RCM Button (Safest)"},{"location":"user_guide/sysnand/entering_rcm/#soldered-joy-con-pads-7-10","text":"Click to expand!
