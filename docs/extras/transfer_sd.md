# Changing microSD cards

The goal of this page is to transfer the contents from one microSD card to another one. The method to do this will differ, depending on whether you're using a partition based emuMMC on your microSD card or not.

We will be using [hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases/) to both backup and restore the emuMMC, so make sure that you have its latest files on your microSD card already.

### Checking whether you have a Partition or File based emuMMC:

You should first check whether you have a file or partition based emuMMC:

1. Enter RCM and inject the hekate payload.
    - If you use a modchipped Switch, you can simply just turn your Switch on with the hekate payload renamed to `payload.bin` on the root of your microSD card.
1.  Tap on the `emuMMC` button.
1.  Under `emuMMC Info & Selection`, check the text next to `Type`.
    - If you have one it should be either `SD Raw Partition` or `SD File`.
    - If you have no emuMMC, it'll be disabled.
    
#### Depending on if you're using a Partition based emuMMC or File based emuMMC/no emuMMC at all, click the corresponding tab below:

**Space for the backup**

You need at least 30GB (or 60GB if using an OLED Switch) of free space to be able to restore the emuMMC!

:::

#### What you need:

- The latest version of [hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/Hekate/releases/) (`hekate_ctcaer_(version).zip`).

#### On your OLD microSD card:

1.  Enter RCM and inject the hekate payload.
    - If you use a modchipped Switch, you can simply just turn your Switch on with the hekate payload renamed to `payload.bin` on the root of your microSD card.
1.  From hekate's `Home` menu, navigate to `Tools` > `Backup eMMC`, set `SD EmuMMC Raw Partition` at the bottom of your screen to `ON`.
1.  Backup both `SD emuMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1` and `SD emuMMC RAW GPP` (Note: `SD emuMMC RAW GPP` may take a while).
1.  Once both are done, go back to the main menu, navigate to `Tools` > `USB Tools` > `SD Card` and plug your Switch into your PC via USB.
1.  If Windows asks you to format a drive, discard it and open the accessible drive containing the contents of your microSD card.
1.  Copy the contents of your old microSD card somewhere to your PC.

#### On your NEW microSD card:

1.  Copy the *contents* of the previously downloaded hekate `.zip` to the root of your new microSD card.
1.  Enter RCM and inject the hekate payload.
    - If you use a modchipped Switch, you can simply just turn your Switch on with the hekate payload renamed to `payload.bin` on the root of your microSD card.
1.  Navigate to `Tools` > `Partition SD card` once in hekate/Nyx.
1.  Set the `emuMMC (RAW)` slider to `29 FULL` in the middle of the bar.
    - Set the `emuMMC (RAW)` slider to `58 FULL` if you're on an OLED Switch.
    - If you wish to install Android and/or Linux later, partition your microSD card here accordingly by moving the sliders you see during this step. We recommend setting the `Android (USER)` and `Linux (EXT4)` sliders to at least 16GB.
1.  Navigate to `Next Step` at the bottom right, then select `Start` in the menu that appears.
    - For Android; Select `Dynamic` partitioning for Android 13+ and `Legacy` partitioning for Android 10/11. Note that Android 10/11 are no longer supported, Legacy and Dynamic partitioning are also **NOT** intercompatible.
1.  After it’s done, return to hekate's `Home` menu and navigate to `Tools` > `USB Tools` > `SD Card`, then plug your Switch into your PC via USB.
1.  Copy the backup you made of your old microSD card on your PC to your new microSD card, replacing files if/when prompted.
1.  Navigate to `/backup/<some characters>/emummc` on your new microSD card and move `BOOT0`, `BOOT1` and the `rawnand.bin.xx` files to `/backup/<some characters>/restore/emummc`.
1.  Eject the `UMS` device safely from within your computer's operating system.
1.  From hekate's `Home` menu, navigate to `Tools` > `Restore eMMC`, set `SD EmuMMC Raw Partition` at the bottom of your screen to `ON`.
1.  Restore the backup by tapping on both `SD emuMMC BOOT0 & BOOT1` and `SD emuMMC RAW GPP` (Note: `SD emuMMC RAW GPP` may take a while).
    - It's important that for both of these options the `SD emuMMC Raw Partition` option is enabled, otherwise you could be altering your sysMMC
      which is not what you want.
1.  Your emuMMC is now restored on the new microSD card and you should be able to launch it from `Launch` -> `Atmosphere PKG3 emuMMC` in hekate.
