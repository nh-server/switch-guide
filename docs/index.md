# NH Switch Guide

A guide collaboration between Nintendo Homebrew's Helpers and Staff, from stock to Atmosphere.

### What is homebrew?

Homebrew applications are custom, user-made software, which haven’t been authorised by Nintendo. This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more.

Homebrew can be run for free on your Switch as long as you have a "first-generation" system, and a USB-C cable.

### What is Custom Firmware?

Custom Firmware (“CFW”) enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can’t easily do. For instance, installing game modifications with ease.

CFW can be set up on any first-generation console on any version (but will require additional tools).

### What does this guide install?
This guide has the end goal of taking a completely unmodified Switch from stock firmware to fusee-gelee powered Custom Firmware.

fusee-gelee is currently the best method of launching Custom Firmware that gives us nearly full control of the system. It utilizes a vulnerability in the bootROM of the first-generation Switch systems, allowing us to send any payload we want to the Switch's recovery mode, instead of only ones that Nintendo have authorized.

### What can I do with Custom Firmware?

* Customize your HOME Menu with user-created themes and splash screens
* Use “ROM hacks” for games that you own
* Backup, edit, and restore saves for many games
* Play games for older systems with various emulators, using RetroArch or other standalone emulators
* Safely update to the latest system version without fear of losing access to homebrew

### What do I need to know before starting?

Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Switch hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They’re rare but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.

This guide will work on first-generation Switch consoles in all regions on firmware 6.1.0 or below.

You will need one of the following in order to successfully follow this guide:

- A USB-A to USB-C cable, and a PC
- A USB-OTG cable, a USB-A to USB-C cable, and an Android device
    - This does not work on every phone
- A USB-C cable, and an Android device with a USB-C port
- A Lightning to USB-C cable, and a jailbroken iOS device
    - This method is not covered by the guide, but you can read more about it at [this website](https://mologie.github.io/nxboot/)

If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved).

Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off!

Custom Firmware is not permanent with current methods, and will be wiped upon rebooting the system.

It is advised that you read the entire guide from start to finish one or more times before actually running through the guide with your system.
